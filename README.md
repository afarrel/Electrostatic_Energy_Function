# Electrostatic_Energy_Function
Energy function that calculates the electrostatic energy between amino acids and nucleic acids in a PDB

Calculates Electrostatic energy using Coulomb's Law using point charges of atoms on amino acids and point charges of nucleic acid atoms determined by Chemaxon's Chemdraw.
It outputs total Electrostatic energy between the protein and DNA in kcal/mol
